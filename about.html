                    <h2>This Is My Community</h2>
                    <p class="lead">I'm Cole Watson, a 4th generation Idaho native and 3rd generation glazier. This isn't just a business to me‚Äîit's my craft, my heritage, and my way of serving the community where my family has deep roots.</p>

                    <p>I've been around glass my entire life. I have photos of myself at 5 years old on job sites with my dad, setting glass in commercial buildings downtown Boise. At 14, I installed my first window in a remodel with him. At 40, I've got 26 years of hands-on experience and knowledge passed down through three generations.</p>

                    <h3>Learning From the Best</h3>
                    <p>My grandfather and father were both union-trained journeymen glaziers. Back when Idaho had a glaziers union, they spent years as apprentices, learning the craft the right way‚Äîfollowing proper standards, understanding building science, and mastering techniques that most contractors today don't even know exist.</p>

                    <p>That training doesn't happen anymore. The union is gone. Idaho's deregulation means anyone with an LLC can call themselves a window installer. But I was raised by men who knew their craft inside and out, and that knowledge is irreplaceable.</p>

                    <h3>Why I Do This</h3>
                    <p>I love the instant gratification of a job well done. Walking away from a customer's home and hearing them say, "Wow, it just looks so good"‚Äîthat never gets old. Whether it's replacing old aluminum windows and dramatically improving a home's curb appeal, or responding to an emergency at 2 AM in negative-degree weather, I'm here to help.</p>

                    <p>But it's deeper than that. I want to see the people in my community get quality products with proper installation at fair prices. I've seen too many homeowners get burned by cheap installations that cause catastrophic water damage years later. Your home deserves better than that.</p>

                    <h3>Faith First</h3>
                    <p>This is a faith-based business. The Lord drives everything I do. I look at this company as His, and I'm just partnering in what He wants me to do. That means integrity, honesty, and treating people the way Christ calls us to treat each other.</p>

                    <p>Idaho is my home. This is my community, where my kids are growing up. When I work on your house, I'm working on my neighbor's house. I want to see the best products with the best installation being done for the people I share this valley with.</p>

                    <h3>Education Matters</h3>
                    <p>I believe in educating homeowners about why quality matters. Not everyone knows that improper window installation can lead to $50,000 in water damage. I want to empower you to make informed decisions about your home.</p>

                    <h3>Craftsmanship</h3>
                    <p>I was trained by union journeymen who learned their craft when standards actually mattered. I follow manufacturer specifications, building codes, and proper techniques‚Äînot shortcuts. Your windows will be installed the way they're supposed to be.</p>

                    <p>Honest assessments. Fair pricing. Real warranties that hold up. If I say I'm going to do something, I do it. If I see a problem, I tell you about it. No pressure, no gimmicks‚Äîjust straight talk.</p>

                    <p>I love talking to customers and solving problems. Whether it's an emergency repair or a complete home transformation, I care about bringing comfort and beauty back to your home. The satisfaction of a job well done matters more than anything else.</p>

                    <p class="lead">My wife and I are pretty new to marriage‚Äîjust coming up on a year. We both came out of difficult previous marriages, and we've learned that God has to be at the center of everything.</p>

                    <p>We're actively involved in ministry‚ÄîI walk with guys coming out of prison, we work with couples navigating marriage challenges, and we're passionate about creating community that reflects Christ's love.</p>

                    <p>That same heart drives this business. I dream of growing it to a point where I can hire guys who just need a chance to restart their lives. Where I can create a work environment where employees wouldn't leave for $10 more an hour because they're loved and valued. Where we do Bible studies in the morning and write scripture on people's walls before installing their windows.</p>

                    <p>I want to build a company that creates family, not just jobs. Where we give gifts to employees' kids at Christmas. Where we share profit when we have a great year. Where guys go home and tell their families, "My boss loves me, and Jesus loves me."</p>

                    <p>We're not there yet. But with God's guidance and patience, we're taking steps in that direction.</p>
